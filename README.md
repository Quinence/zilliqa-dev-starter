# Zilliqa Development Starter

This repository outlines how to get started with development on the Zilliqa Blockchain. It also lists tutorials, courses, and tools on Zilliqa development.

## Quickstart

Zilliqa is the first public blockchain built entirely on a sharded architecture that's scalable, secure, decentralised, fast and low-cost. To design smart contracts, Zilliqa uses Scilla â€” an intermediate-level smart contract language developed with contract safety being prioritized.

It is not strictly necessary to understand the design of Zilliqa architecture to start developing on Zilliqa. Nonetheless, the Zilliqa Design Story is an important read before diving deeper.
